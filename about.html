        <p>
            I created the Rocketry Launch Spreadsheet to make recording and analyzing launch data easier.

            I wrote down all of my ideas that I had about a program that would record inputed launch data. I did it on my iPad so that I could both type up notes and also draw diagrams.

            This is what the paper launch sheet looked like. It took a long time to write out each data entry, especially with cold hands that couldn't hold a pencil very well. Also, some team member's handwriting would not be the best, resulting in data that couldn't be read.
